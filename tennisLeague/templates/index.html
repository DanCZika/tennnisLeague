<div class="row"><h2>Hi all, 👋</h2></div>

<div class="row mt-3"><p>There is only a few tournaments are held in Aberdeenshire (only one will be held until new year) </p></div>
<div class="row"><p>I wanted to organise a league where competitive players can have some quality matches until the next summer league starts.</p></div>
<div class="row"><p>The format will be similar to the local tennis league, with one big group round and the player with the most points wins the league. Matches are best of 3 sets. At the beginning of the season the players will get the contact numbers of their group, and they have to self organise the matches over the period of the round . For further info please check out the rules tab.
</p></div>
<div class="row"><p>To enter the competition you have to register first. After you fill out your personal details (Name, e-mal, phone) you can register. The first round will start on 17th of October and run until 21th of November. 🎾</p></div>

<div class="row"><p>It is free of charge but if you want to support the league you can buy me a coffee <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/danidobos"> ☕</a> at ( <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/danidobos"> buymeacoffee.com</a>). </p></div>

<div class="row"><p>The site is still under construction, but will be improved when the round starts 🏗️</p></div>
